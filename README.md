UTA-VIRT-DATA-PT-09-2024-U-LOLC Module 9 Challenge

Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Files  
- Folder: EmployeeCSV (contains all the CSVs that were imported in PostgreSQL)
- Folder: EmployeeSQL (create_schema.sql - creates all the tables in which the csvs were imported / employee_data_queries.sql - contains all the queries required)
- EmployeeERD.txt and EmployeesERD_QuickDBD-export.png - shows the sketch of the Entity Relashioship Diagram of the tables.
